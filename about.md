# Menu Loop Manager Mod

## <cy>Warning!</c>
Using this mod disables RobTop's Menu Loop Selector, so before installing, check that you don't have a song toggled, as that will cause the mod to overlap the existing custom song you're using.

## About
The Menu Loop Manager Mod allows you to select custom menu music (with .mp3) without needing to close out or restart your game. With this mod, you get the ability to customize the menu loop with your favorite songs. This mod introduces a simplistic but intuitive interface for easily managing and selecting your desired tracks, making your background music experience far better. 
- **Windows Only (for now, sorry)**

## Features
* *<cr>Custom Music Selection:</c>*  Choose any MP3 file from your computer to play as the menu music.

## How to Use
Click on the new plus button in the modâ€™s interface to open an MP3 File request, and then simply choose MP3 files which will be automatically added to a new directory in game for saving your music playlist each time you load your game.
